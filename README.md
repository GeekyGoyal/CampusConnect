# CampusConnect

To develop a MERN-based social networking web application that aims to connect peers within the college to share their stories, and interesting insights and help each other grow.

## Problem Statement

CampusConnect is a MERN-based web application that aims to connect peers within the college. CampusConnect is a one-stop-shop for college students. It is a social networking application built exclusively to bridge the gap among college students. Due to COVID-19, we have seen a sudden and drastic shift in digital life. This transition has also been observed in the education sector as well, with lectures moving away from the traditional
classroom model to online sessions which have tremendously affected the interaction among students. Remote learning has seized the access to the guidance of college seniors. Due to this, students are clueless about the
companies visiting their colleges, the interview process, and the preparation strategy. Also, Finding a teammate for peer programming or hackathons is a hell of a lot of job for college students. CampusConnect is the ultimate solution where you can learn from others, share your work, and extend your toolset with a diverse group of developers, creators, recruiters, content writers, and many more from around the world.
